## Project 1: Sentiments behind song lyrics


### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2019

+ Projec title: Sentiments behind song lyrics
+ This project is conducted by Qiwen Gao

+ Project summary: In this project, I analyze the lyrics data to see the sentiments conveyed in different music genres. I mainly focus on three genres: Rock,Jazz and Metal. Among them, I also make a comparison between the Jazz and Metal music lyrics. My conclusions are as following:  
 * Compared with other music genres, Rock music takes a large proportion in the data set. The weights of positive and negative attitudes reflected in the lyrics of Rock music are similar to each other.\
 * The musis genre which contains the most negative emotions in its lyrics is Metal music, while the one which contains the most positive emotions in its lyrics is Jazz music. \
 * The Jazz music and Metal music are almost "opposite" styles after comparing their song lyrics. While the lyrics in Jazz music bring us sweet and warm emotions, the one in Metal music bring us dark and negative feelings.
